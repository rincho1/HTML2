            <th style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255); text-align: justify;">The most common type of software is application software, or apps, which is performed by the end-user and lets you complete your tasks. An end-user is the individual using the device. Individuals may also refer to these applications as non-essential software. You can install these applications on your devices yourself. Additionally, several types of application software can help you complete many tasks. </th>

            <th style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255); text-align: justify;">System software helps you, the hardware of your device and the application software work together to help you complete your tasks. A computer system relies on software systems to allow it to function properly and efficiently. For example, the memory of your device is part of your system software. Unlike the application software, the system software it's not end-user oriented, which means these programs run in the background of your devices instead of you using them. This means you can use the application software while the system software runs in the background to assist the apps' operations.</th>

            <th style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255); text-align: justify;">The driver software is part of the system software, and this can help your computer manage the external devices you connect to it. This tool can help the device plugged in to operate as intended. Driver software helps translate the commands of the hardware or device's operating system to complete the task. For each device you have plugged into your computer, it requires one driver software. Often, the external devices come with installed drivers, which means you won't need a third-party installation. If the device doesn't have a built-in driver, you can install your own with a third party.</th>

            <th style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255); text-align: justify;">Programming software is for coding and not primarily user-end unless you're a professional who uses and writes codes. As a programmer, you can use this type of software to write, produce, inspect and debug application and system software. These programs can help make completing your tasks more productive and efficient. Additionally, coders can use this software as a translator program. A translator program means it interprets program coding language into machine language code. This helps programmers run code by each line and ensure it's correct so the computer can complete basic instructions.</th>
