            <th style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255); text-align: justify;">In computing and computer science, a processor or processing unit is an electrical component (digital circuit) that performs operations on an external data source, usually memory or some other data stream. It typically takes the form of a microprocessor, which can be implemented on a single or a few tightly integrated metaloxidesemiconductor integrated circuit chips. In the past, processors were constructed using multiple individual vacuum tubes, multiple individual transistors, or multiple integrated circuits.</th>

It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals. Unlike a backplane, a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems, such as the central processor, the chipset's input/output and memory controllers, interface connectors, and other components integrated for general use.</th>

RAM is used to store working data and machine code that the computer needs to access quickly123. RAM is a temporary memory bank that keeps data easily accessible for the processor, as opposed to long-term storage on the hard drive</th>

It is sometimes called semiconductor storage device or solid-state device. It is also called solid-state disk because it is frequently interfaced to a host system in the same manner as a hard disk drive (HDD).</th>

            <th style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255); text-align: justify;">A power supply is an electrical device that supplies electric power to an electrical load. The main purpose of a power supply is to convert electric current from a source to the correct voltage, current, and frequency to power the load. As a result, power supplies are sometimes referred to as electric power converters. Some power supplies are separate standalone pieces of equipment, while others are built into the load appliances that they power.</th>

From the 1980s onward, computers (and their monitors) have been used for both data processing and video, while televisions have implemented some computer functionality. In the 2000s, the typical display aspect ratio of both televisions and computer monitors changed from 4:3 to 16:9.</th>

Replacing early punched cards and paper tape technology, interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards have been the main input method for computers since the 1970s, supplemented by the computer mouse since the 1980s.</th>
